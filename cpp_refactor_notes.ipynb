    "# C++ Snake Game Refactoring for RL Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook documents the refactoring process of a C++ Snake Game to improve its structure for educational purposes and prepare it for Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Codebase Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: Clear separation into logical components (Snake, Apple, Graphics, Game)\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Structure**: Proper use of classes for game entities\n",
    "- **OpenGL Integration**: Working graphics implementation with FreeGLUT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas for Improvement\n",
    "1. **Global State Management**: Heavy reliance on global variables (`gameState`, `snake`, `apple`)\n",
    "2. **Tight Coupling**: Graphics and game logic are tightly coupled\n",
    "3. **No RL Interface**: No abstraction for state representation or action handling\n",
    "4. **Limited Extensibility**: Hard to modify game rules or add new features\n",
    "5. **Documentation**: Inconsistent documentation and commenting\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling and validation\n",
    "7. **Modern C++**: Not utilizing modern C++ features (C++17 is targeted but not fully used)"
